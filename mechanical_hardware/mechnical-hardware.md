# Mechanical Hardware

This document tracks the mechanical design of the robot chassis and related 3D‑printed parts that I design and print myself, primarily using Autodesk Fusion 360 and my BambuLab P1S printer.

---

## Scope

The mechanical documentation in this file covers: 

- Overall chassis concept and footprint  
- Wheel, caster, and support geometry  
- Mounting points for electronics and sensors (mechanical aspects only)  
- 3D‑printing considerations and tolerances  
- Version history of my CAD models and printed prototypes

## Third-Party CAD Models

The following CAD models were sourced from GrabCAD for reference and assembly visualisation. They are **not** designed by me. All rights remain with the original authors.

### Missing Models

| Component | Reason |
|-----------|---------|
| HW-140 Buck Converter | No suitable CAD model found on GrabCAD — placeholder geometry to be modelled manually if needed for assembly |
